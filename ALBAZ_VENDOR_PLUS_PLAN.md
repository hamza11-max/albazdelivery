## 💳 Subscription Plans

### Plan 1: Starter (Free/Basic)
**Target:** Small vendors, new businesses, testing phase

**Features:**
- Basic POS functionality
- Up to 5 products
- Basic inventory management
- Sales history window aligned to Starter entitlements in the app (**~1 month slice** in `PLAN_FEATURES`; not a separate rolling 30-day engine unless product adds one)
- Basic reporting
- Manual order management
- Single device access
- Basic receipt printing

**Limitations:**
- No cloud sync
- No advanced analytics
- No multi-user access
- No API access
- Limited backup options

**Price:** Free or $0/month

---

### Free trial (vendor app — Professional, 14 days)

- **Audience:** New vendors who have not used a trial on the same account (`trialStart` is null) and who are **not already on an active paid plan** (Starter is OK unless they were previously trialling or migrated by support).
- **What they get:** Full **Professional** feature baseline from [`lib/subscription-plans.ts`](lib/subscription-plans.ts): higher product caps, cloud sync, WhatsApp Flows where enabled, **`brandedSubdomain: true`**, etc., for **14 days** (`VENDOR_FREE_TRIAL_DAYS`, overridable server-side via `VENDOR_TRIAL_DAYS`).
- **Billing:** No card required — suitable for **COD-first** rollout. Stripe checkout remains optional for later self-serve card billing.
- **After day 14:** Subscription is **lazily downgraded** to **Starter** (`ACTIVE`) on the next `GET /api/subscriptions`; `trialStart` / `trialEnd` are kept for analytics. Vendors can then continue on Starter or upgrade via admin / future payment flows.
- **UX:** Vendor app shows a **banner** during trial and a **“Start 14-day trial”** CTA under **Paramètres → Paiements** when eligible.
